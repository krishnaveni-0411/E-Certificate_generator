> Place your Excel sheet with participant details in the same folder.

> Ensure your certificate template image (e.g., data_alchemy.png) is in the same folder.

> Ensure your font file (e.g., LucidaUnicodeCalligraphy.ttf) is available in the folder.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
Open the folder in VS Code (or any IDE).

**Run the script:**

python certificate_generator.py

A file picker pop-up will appear.

install('openpyxl')
install('Pillow')
